  Email Alerts

  
do the following:

  
   Go to Setup | Build | Create | Workflow &
       Approvals | Email Alerts

   Find these of Email Alerts, which are
       using the current  Business Practices Group organization-wide
       address in From Email Address
       field. Ideally, change the view of Email alerts list, to include From Email Address column.

   Temporarily - change value of From Email Address to Current User, or any other
       address. Remember to note down modified Email Alerts for a future
       reference (or just rely on Last Modified column).

   Now, when current Business Practices
       Group address is no longer in use in Email Alerts, you can update Business Practices Group as
       previously described.

   When Business Practices Group is successfully updated, go back to
       Email Alerts and change the value of From
       Email Address field of recently modified alerts, back to Business Practices Group.
